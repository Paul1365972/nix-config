# Community Support (Discussions)

Everyone is welcome to participate in [Den discussions](https://github.com/vic/den/discussions). The only rule is to be mindful and respectful of each other. We value people's time as you value yours, and we all deserve the respect you also deserve.

Join us in the discussion, share your thoughts about Den, how you are using it, or ideas on how we can make it better.

Come, get help, and help others along the way.
